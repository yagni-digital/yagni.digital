A website for the YAGNI Digital brand.

## To run

There's an `.nvmrc` for those who use NVM you'll want to run `nvm install && nvm use`.

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the browser and visit http://localhost:3000/

## To deploy

Assuming you have permission to deploy you'll be provided with an AWS credential to use, then just run:

```
./deploy.sh
```

in the root of the project and it'll deploy (a simple deployment approach for a simple site).
